# Census Health Chart

This chart used D3.js to show data from the 2014 U.S. Census and display the relationship between the percentage of a state's population that lived in poverty to the percentage that lacked healthcare.

The chart appears to show that states with higher levels of poverty have higher levels of uninsured residents.
