          <h3>States with higher rate of poverty have less health coverage</h3>
          <h6><strong>By Marshall Doig</strong></h6>
          <p>According to an analysis of 2014 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, states with a higher rate 
            of poverty appeared to have higher rates of uninsured residents.</p>

          <p>Leading the way in high poverty and lower healthcare coverage were a handful of Southern states, 
            including Texas, which had a poverty rate of 17.2 percent and which led the nation with 
            an uninsured rate of 24.9 percent.</p>

          <p>Massachusetts, with an established statewide health system that aims to provide coverage for all its
            residents, led all states and the District of Columbia with a 4.6 percent uninsured rate while also
            holding a relatively low 11.6 percent poverty rate.</p>
